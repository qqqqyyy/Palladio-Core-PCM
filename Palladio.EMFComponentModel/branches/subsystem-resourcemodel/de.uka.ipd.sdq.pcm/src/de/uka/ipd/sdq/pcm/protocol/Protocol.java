/**

 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Protocol</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * A protocol is a set of calling sequences and can be optionally added to an interface. Protocols of provided
 * interfaces specify the order in which services have to be called by clients. Protocols of required interfaces
 * specify the actual order in which the component calls required services.
 * 
 * Besides finite state machines, different formalisms can be used to model protocols. The PCM does
 * not restrict the protocol modelling formalisms. For example, Petri nets or regular expressions could
 * model interface protocols. However, the choice of a formalism does influence possible analyses. For
 * example, to check the interoperability of two components A and B, the language inclusion of the required
 * protocol of A within the provided protocol of B has to be tested. The language inclusion is undecidable for
 * Petri nets in the general case, so protocols modelled with Petri nets cannot be checked for interoperability.
 * Notice, that although protocols are able to express the state of a component, interfaces themselves
 * are stateless. The protocol state only depends on the component that implements the interface and is only
 * present during component runtime. Components can provide/require multiple interfaces, but the PCM
 * does not support protocols ranging over multiple interfaces (neither for provided nor required protocols).
 * The complete state of a components consists of all its interface states. Restrictions on the complete state
 * cannot be expressed in the PCM, as protocols can only be specified for single interfaces.
